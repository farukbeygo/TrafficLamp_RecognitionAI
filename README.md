# TrafficLamp_RecognitionAI

  Hello, we are developing our traffic lamb recognition algorithm to pass classic google captcha
  ,and also, we will not use a complex AI system or TensorFlow. We will take our data from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php and  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mbornoe/lisa-traffic-light-dataset, also put it in this repository that data we have used
